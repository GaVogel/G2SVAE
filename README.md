# Graph-to-String Variational Autoencoder for Synthetic Polymer Design
This repository contains the implementation of the Graph-to-String Variational Autoencoder (G2S-VAE) model presented in the publication titled "Graph-to-String Variational Autoencoder for Synthetic Polymer Design." The G2S-VAE is designed to generate synthetic polymer structures by translating polymer graphs into polymer strings using a variational autoencoder architecture.
